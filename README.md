# Building AI course – small AI project

This repository contains a small AI project created for the **Building AI** course.  
The main goal is to practice basic machine learning concepts and Python programming.

## Contents

- Simple examples of:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Basic models (e.g. linear regression, k‑nearest neighbours, logistic regression)
  - Evaluation with simple metrics
- Exercise notebooks and scripts used in the course

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Common libraries such as:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib/jupyter (if notebooks are used)

Install dependencies (example):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

```
# Example
python example_model.py
```

or open the Jupyter notebooks:

```
jupyter notebook
```

## Purpose

This project is purely educational and is used to experiment with AI techniques introduced in the Building AI course.
